	<h1>The Information of Population</h1>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--The national identification information system project</li>
      <p align="left">When a citizen checks an identification information, the user just needs to send the information such as name and ID card number to the national identification information database to compare, and gets a result of “same” or ”not same”. If it is the same, the system can compare the photo to make sure whether the person in photo is the same one as the ID card given. The system Neusoft provides for the police takes the advantages of the basic data in the population information management system of the police to provide a system that can do national identification service and necessary data exchange or sharing. It can load a population of 13 billion and has a capacity over 20TB. The system provides 4, 000 users about 250 million times of service in the fields such as paralytics committee, industry and commerce, tax, notarization, bank, insurance, security, telecommunication, E-commerce and so on, at an  average speed about 500 thousand times a day,7,400 thousand times when highest. It has helped to confirm the information of about 18 million disables and given out about 10 million disabled cards to the disables for Chinese paralytics committee. For the clients, it’s remarkable that this is a system that has the largest population in the world so far. It is very effective in preventing swindle and crimes using counterfeit ID cards. The system also can check the people concerned during register to reduce the risk and increase the credit and service ability of the government.</p>
      <h1>Safe Expo and Cozy Homeland</h1>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--Online police system project for Shanghai Expo </li>
      <p>There are 140 million permanent residents, 300 million actual population, 700 million visitors, 18 departments directly under the city government and county government, and more than 30 departments including frontier defense, fire control and so on in Shanghai. There were more than 30 thousand police cooperation with each other and Shanghai Public Security Bureau undertook the crucial security work during the Expo. To help Shanghai Public Security Bureau launch the security work better, we constructed the criminal case, law enforcement supervision, property involved three systems in the five big systems in the program to provide a more normalized and justified process for solving the cases. It saved 80% time spending in case solving and cut down the cost greatly. At the same time, the systems could remind us of the custody time to preventing exceeding the time limit. It deserves to be mentioned that it has the largest population using this system in China.  For our clients, after a long time use, a database about the cases and criminals can be founded gradually and it can analyze the rate of crimes, the high-rate regions, the types of the crimes. The systems make crime early warning come true, exchange “solving” to “warning”.</p>
      <h1>Fresh City and Harmonious Expo</h1>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--Construction waste and engineering waste disposal and management system project for Shanghai Expo</li>
      <p>Construction and engineering waste is a serious problem. There were 6,000 thousands tons of construction waste produced during the Expo. It means that we need 600 thousand trucks each can load 10 tons. In the past, the random pouring of the construction waste and the environmental problems it caused were always regarded as chronic diseases. To prevent the bad effects which brought by the optional pouring in our city, we equipped devices that can record the load and unload at construction sites and unload sites, and installed active RFID and automobile data recorder at the qualified trucks. When trucks entered or went out of the construction sites or unload sites, they did not need to stop. The system itself could distinguish and decide from a long distance. Also we could look up the routes trucks drove through GPRS. We could have 100 users on line at the same time and the maximum time we needed for searching was less than 5 seconds. We could open a page within 3 seconds at average. For our clients, this program could manage the construction waste in the whole process, reduced the happening of the random pouring. This ensured the environment and cut down the expenses used on clean the waste the 2nd time afforded by public finance. At the same time, it ensured the operation of the legal market and helped to foster the long-term management system of construction and engineering waste.</p>
      <h1>Transparent, Open and Honest Purchase</h1>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--Platform project for information management of government purchase</li>
      <p>The public focus on how to build a “full coverage, whole process, full internet access, full transparent” government purchase information management system all the time. The 1st platform we built for the municipal government was on line at 1st, January, 2009, and the platform has an E-market, providing a straight and quick on-line commercial environment. The 2nd platform based on the trade environment and frame provided by the 1st one and founded a platform for tenders. The construction included making tender hall, mould resources, rules known to public. We devoted ourselves to provide an open and fair tender environment for government purchase. This program served as a link between past and future. It shared the data with the 1st one, linked well with the 1st platform and had the same way with the 1st one on segmentation. Also, people could comment on the tenders on the Internet, and in the future people can do that even when they are in another city. For our clients, this program could unify the legal government chase processes, control the process better so that they can prevent corruption from the beginning, the institutions and the means. Moreover, the program unified access rules of agreement commodity, enlarged the influence of the scale stock, increased the benefit of the government purchase and ensured the stability of the object of transaction.</p>
      <h1>Tracing Back to the Origin of Food to Ensure the Safety of Citizen Lives</h1>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--Tracing back system project of meat and vegetables for Kunming</li>
      <p>From ground to table, vegetables must be registered from the beginning of their growth at the origin, even though a cabbage. We built 4 slaughterhouses, 4 vegetable wholesale markets, 100 farmers markets, 20 large supermarkets and 300 fresh markets as trace back system of meat and vegetables for some important points. The system we provided Kunming government brought about the electronic receipts and sales subsidiary of meat and vegetables and solved the problem that the sources, uses and responsibility are unclear. Now citizens in Kunming can search relative information about the vegetables and meat they buy and can complain. Kunming is one of the ten trace back system of meat and vegetables experimental points.

      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;--Networking ticket in highway transportation for Expo project</li>
        <p>Old towns are another tow attractions for the visitors. Due to the limits of the air and the railway, highway transportation will have its responsibility for short trips during the Expo. Shanghai station sends 50-60 thousands passengers on average everyday and undertook 60%-70%transportation of the Yangtze River Delta during the Expo. How to ensure that visitors could travel without any problems and shortened the waiting time became the crucial task for highway transportation. It was not difficult to find that networking ticket was extended when the Expo was hold. There are 37 passenger stations in Shanghai. Neusoft connected 23 of them to the system and 6 of their sales system could combine, giving convenience to the visitors.
